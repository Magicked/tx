Threat Exchange Utilities
-------------------------
This is a collection of simple python utilities for working with Facebook's ThreatExchange. If you want to do advanced things, you may want to check out the API yourself. :)

Installation
------------
As with most things python, you can use a virtualenv to get your own environment set up.
```
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Then go into the tx dir and run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then cp etc/tx.ini.example to etc/tx.ini and fill in your app_id and app_secret
